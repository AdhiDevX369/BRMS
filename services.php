              New business registration is the process of officially establishing a new business entity
			  with the appropriate government authorities. This involves choosing a business name, determining
			  the business structure (such as sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation), and submitting
			  the required documents. The registration grants the business legal recognition and enables it to 
			  operate within the law, obtain licenses, and start trading. Itâ€™s the first step for entrepreneurs 
			  looking to launch their ventures.

            <p class="card-text">
              Canceling a business refers to the formal process of dissolving or terminating a business entity.
			  This may occur due to various reasons, such as the owner deciding to retire, pursue other ventures,
			  or due to financial challenges. The cancellation process involves notifying the relevant authorities,
			  settling any outstanding taxes, liabilities, and obligations, and filing the necessary forms to 
			  officially close the business. Once complete, the business is no longer recognized as an active entity 
			  and cannot legally operate.

            <p class="card-text">
              Changing a business refers to making modifications to the legal structure, ownership, name, or other key
			  details of an already established business. Common changes include switching from a sole proprietorship 
			  to a corporation, changing the business name, or updating the registered address. These changes often require
			  filing specific paperwork with the government and informing relevant stakeholders, ensuring that the business
			  remains compliant with local regulations after the modifications.
